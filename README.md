# Speech-Recognition-with-Python
Used Python Speech Recognition library and Google's free web search API, Google Recognizer, to create a python program that will recognize speech in an audio file and convert it to text.

This project was done using a pre-recorded audio file in the .wav format. The audio file was then converted into an audio data file to be recognized by the Google Recognizer.
